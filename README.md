# [UT BUDDY](https://main.d3gzi5eplp517x.amplifyapp.com/#/)



**UT Buddy** is an utilities Super App that allows a user to access several services from one single web application. It is also an integrated utility tracker for appliances at home that includes bill payments and live-tracking of the appliances. Currently, there is shortage of integrated utility apps and users will need to pay utility bills separately which can be a huge hassle. Moreover, the utilities bill only comes once a month, and users do not have the visibility over their consumption rate, which makes tracking of the bills difficult. 



**UT buddy** is therefore established to over the existing limitations, by offering different functionalities integrated seamlessly under 1 application. **UT Buddy** aims to offer the user greater visibility over their consumption behaviour, and  we believe that with greater oversights of their consumption habit, **UT buddy** can encourage the users to be more mindful of their consumption behaviour and help the users save on their utilities. **UT Buddy** consists of 4 main pages, namely the **Dashboard Page**, **Bills Page**, **Community Page**, **Live-Tracking Page** and **Profile Page**
